# news-ticker-teleprompter
A teleprompter that scrolls a user-selected text file marquee/news ticker style so that an on-camera reader can look directly below their webcam without having shifty eyes.

This is in Python 3, and will only be tested on Windows 11. If users report test results from other OSes, I'll update here.

## Ensure you have Python 3 installed
From a Windows command line, run 
**>**```python --version```

Confirm you have tkinter installed
**>**```python -m tkinter```

If you don't have tkinter already, install it 
**>**```pip install tk```

Once you have your environment ready, start the ticker
**>**```python news_ticker.py```
